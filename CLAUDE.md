## ⚠️ STRICT DEVELOPMENT RULES

**IMPORTANT: These rules MUST be followed when continuing this implementation:**

1. **No Over-Engineering** - Only implement what is explicitly requested. No additional features or "nice-to-haves" unless explicitly asked.

2. **Facts Only, No Assumptions** - Base all decisions on actual code, database schema, and explicit requirements. If unclear, investigate first or ask.

3. **Don't Break Anything** - Before making changes, understand what exists and how it works. Test thoroughly. Preserve working functionality.
